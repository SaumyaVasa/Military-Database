# Military Database System

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive database system designed for managing military operations and personnel records. It was developed as part of the **IT-214: Database Management Systems** course.

Our aim was to design a real-world, scalable, and normalized database system that reflects actual military organizational structures and data. It also includes a **Java console application** for flexible interaction and **Python automation** for generating realistic data.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Real Military Data** – Equipment, wars fought, awards, and current personnel statuses.
- 🧠 **Well-Normalized Schema** – Reduced redundancy, increased performance.
- 🖥️ **Java Console Interface** – Secure access for authorized users.
- 🐍 **Python Automation** – Random realistic data generation for large tuples.
- 📄 **Full Documentation** – Schema diagrams, SQL scripts, and usage notes included.

---

## 🧩 Technical Challenges & Solutions

- 🔁 **Cyclic Foreign Keys** – Solved using `ALTER TABLE` and redesigning relationships.
- 🔒 **Connection Limits** – Learned about PostgreSQL connection configurations by experience.
- 🛠️ **Schema Revisions** – Multiple updates based on testing and optimization of relationships.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgAdmin
- **Languages**: SQL, Java, Python
- **Tools**: Java IDEs, ER Diagram software
- **Environment**: Local PostgreSQL instances for development and testing

## 📌 How to Run

### Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL installed and running
- Java JDK installed
- Python 3 (optional, for data scripts)

### Setup Steps

1. **Database Initialization**
    - Create the PostgreSQL database.
    - Execute provided SQL scripts to generate tables and constraints.

2. **Populate Data**
    - Run Python scripts (if provided) to generate test data.
    - Or insert values manually from the documentation.

3. **Java Console App**
    - Open the Java source files in your IDE.
    - Set DB credentials in code or config file.
    - Compile and run to access the system.
